# BoingSearch

Inspired by [FrogFind](http://github.com/ActionRetro/FrogFind) search engine for use with Amiga-compatible computer(and other retro stuff).

It uses [SerpAPI](https://serpapi.com) as source of SERP response and utilizes "Readability" mode-like HTML simplifier for making smaller web pages from normal one that you will get without it. 

It written in Rust and can work without any additional web-server.
