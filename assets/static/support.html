        <p>This project is completely open source, free to use, and respects your privacy.</p>
        <p>It’s built and maintained with care — and your support helps keep it running for everyone.</p>

            Why Your Support Matters? 
        </h2>
        <p>
            Running this service isn't free.
        </p>
        <p>I personally cover all expenses for:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Hosting and Domain</b> - keeping the servers online and responsive.</li>
            <li><b>SerpAPI</b> - a paid API used to deliver accurate, real-time search results.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            Every small donation helps cover these costs and keeps the service fast, reliable, and ad-free.
        </p>
